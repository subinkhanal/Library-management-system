# Library-management-system
A Library Management System (LMS) is software designed to manage a library's primary housekeeping functions. Libraries use library services to keep track of their resource collections and relationships with their members. Libraries may use library management systems to track books, checkouts, subscriber accounts, and subscriptions. 
Maintaining the records for entering new books and tracking books that have been borrow with their due dates is also part of library management systems.
